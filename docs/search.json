Advances in\ntechnology and large-scale data mobilization efforts now generate huge\namounts of multi-dimensional biodiversity data, in many cases outpacing\nour ability to rapidly synthesize disparate data types into actionable\nknowledge. My research program focuses on developing methodologies and\nleveraging emerging technologies to harness the power of big data to\ngain new ecological insights and create global biodiversity metrics that\ncan inform policy choices.\nOur group focuses on:\nleveraging automated biodiversity sensors (e.g. audio recorders,\ncamera traps)\nusing tracking technology to understand how animals navigate\nincreasingly modified environments\ndeveloping global metrics to track progress on filling biodiversity\ndata gaps\ncreating a more equitable scientific community, by listening,\nlearning, struggling, and trying again\nIf any of this interests you, see details on joining below!\nPeople\n\n\n\n\nRuth Oliver (she/her/hers)\nAssistant Professor - UCSBAssociate Research Scientist - Yale UniversityPhD - Earth & Environmental Science, Columbia\nUniversityBA - Physics, Claremeont McKenna College\nemail: rutholiver@bren.ucsb.edu\n\nJoin!\nAdd text\nThis website is based on a template\ncreated by Dr. Allison Horst.\n\n\n\n",

You are encouraged to structure your course\nhowever works best for your class. All of your course\ninformation could be on a single page, or you might have a different\nnumber of topics, or organize weekly, or any other organization that\nworks for you.\n\nTO UPDATE THIS PAGE: Open and edit the topic_1.Rmd file,\nin the project root, to delete this placeholder text and customize with\nyour own!\n\nAdd a site page\nThe quick version:\nMake a new R Markdown document, save\nAdd the rendered .html to _site.yaml so the page exists on the\nsite\nBuild to see updated site\nBelow for a bit more detail…\nMake each page an R\nMarkdown document\nTo make a new page:\nWithin your website Project, create a new .Rmd (File > New\nFile > R Markdown). Save it to the project root. For this example,\nlet’s say you’ve saved it as new_page.Rmd.\nIn that .Rmd file, remove everything but the title (which you can\nchange) from the YAML - that’s the top section of the .Rmd, where by\ndefault it has title, author, date, etc.\nUpdate the .Rmd to contain whatever you want to have on that\npage. Don’t know a lot about markdown? Considering switching over to the\nVisual\nEditor in RStudio (versions >= 1.4).\nSave the .Rmd\nAdd it to your navigation\nbar\nOpen the _site.yml file in your Project\nAdd the information to the YAML navbar section, which will almost\nalways be the text that you want to appear in the navigation bar, and\nthe file name of the knitted html that will be\nautomatically rendered to /docs when you Build your website. That would\nbe new_page.html for this example (since the .Rmd it is\nrendered from is new_page.Rmd). So in the\n_site.yml I would need to add this to the navbar\nsection:\n    - text: \"A new page!\"\n      href: new_page.html\nNote: YAML is space & indentation specific.\nFollow the structure that already exists in this template to avoid YAML\nerrors.\nHow is the website finding the html? Notice in the\n_site.yml file, the output_dir is set to\ndocs. That means when we press ‘Build website’ (in the\nBuild tab in RStudio), our .Rmd pages are knitted to HTML & sent to\nthe _docs folder. This is also important because when we\ndeploy the site (make it live), we will want to deploy from that\ndocs folder using GitHub pages.\nTake a look at some other pages in this template (Resources,\nAssignments, etc.) to see the structure, & give it a shot!\nDelete/disappear a site page\nThe safest thing to do if you don’t want a page to show up\nis to remove it from the _site.yml navbar listings. That\nway, the material on the page still exists as a file in your project,\nbut doesn’t show up on the website – don’t delete a page file unless you\nare REALLY SURE that you’re never going to want the material on that\npage ever again.\n\n\n\n",
