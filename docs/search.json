Advances in technology and large-scale data mobilization efforts now generate huge amounts of multi-dimensional biodiversity data, in many cases outpacing our ability to rapidly synthesize disparate data types into actionable knowledge. My research program focuses on developing methodologies and leveraging emerging technologies to harness the power of big data to gain new ecological insights.\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nRuth Oliver\n\nAssistant Professor\nKuni Endowed Junior Faculty Fellow\n(she/her)email: rutholiver@bren.ucsb.edudownload CV\n\nJoin!\nI’m looking forward to building a supportive and collaborative lab group. There are opportunities to join existing projects and developing new projects together.\nGraduate students\nPhD students can join the group through the Bren School PhD program.\nI will be recruiting students to start fall 2024.\nInstead of emailing me, please fill out the interest survey below, so I can better organize my responses.\nPlease check out the Resources page for tips on how to craft your message.\nNote: You are more than welcome to reach out to other potential advisors at UCSB.\nPostdoctoral researchers\nI will be welcoming postdocs on an ongoing basis, depending on funding availability. If our research interests align, please fill out the interest survey below. I am happy to develop fellowship proposal(s) together. Please check out the Resources page for a list of potential fellowships. I am currently recruiting through the Bren Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship.\nInterest survey\nFill out here!\nThis website is based on a template created by Dr. Allison Horst.\n\n\n\n",
